# Data-Science-Property-Price-Prediction
In this project I have collated my skills in ML and webscraping to collect data on the Nottingham housing market and train a ML model to predict house prices.

Introduction

In this repo I went from house listings on Rightmove to predicating house prices in Nottingham.
My goal was to collect data on houses in Nottingham and then train a simple machine learning model to predict house prices. 

The three Main steps were :
1. Webscraping — (Selenium, Beautiful Soup)
2. Data Manipulation — (Pandas, Numpy)
3. Training Model — (Sklearn, Pandas)
Lets get into it!
